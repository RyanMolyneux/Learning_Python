WORK ACHIEVED
--------------
Today the ship module is finished for now allowing the ship to be dsplayed
on the screen & objects of its type to be created,next came refactoring
of the project to make it more modular & simpler to manage so alot of 
the operations performed in the main module were grouped up & moved into
the game functions module, lastly done was some revision of the type
of work over the past two days that I have been performing so as to
test I know what I have been doing & that I understand it.

WORK ACHIEVED

Last time working on this project I finished up the movement of the
space ship, some refractoring of the code that allows the ship to move
& the constraints that keep the ship from moving of the display, today
hope to finish up some revision of this work I have done then finish
up this chapter & start the next

WORK ACHIEVED
--------------
The last bit of work from yesterday took longer than I had anticipated
so what happend first was the revision then started the part to allow 
the players ship to shoot bullets for that new module was need holding
new class called bullet & we also need groups so it is much easier to 
keep track & update all the bullets that were fired on screen, now what needs
to be done is delete bullets which go off screen so old bullets no longer
needed in game to free up some of the computers resources and make the
game more efficient.

WORK ACHIEVED
--------------
As of yesterday I have finished up the end of chapter 12 which consisted of 
small things like removing bullets that have disappeared of screen to save space
, settings a bullet cap & some refractoring & to finish it off some revision which
required me to preaty much recreate the game but from the left side of the screen 
with you ship movement being along the y-axis, as for today start chapte 13.
